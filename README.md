**Is the learning of relationships between objects in a visual scene grounded in the actions an agent takes towards them?**

We are investigating this question by:

1) Exploring defeceits of standard CNNs and MLPs in learning contentent-independent structural elements (ie Cardinality) of a complex visual scene consisting of omniglot charachters 

2) Implementing a glimpse model that saccades over images based on a saliency map (Itti and Koch)

3) Collect human eye-tracking data and compare the performance of the glimpse model using this data on relational reasoning tasks with the model-generated saccadic patterns
